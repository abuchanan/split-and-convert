This contains a few pieces:

* kseq.h comes from http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/kseq.shtml
  Thank you Heng Li!

* main.c (compile to strip-and-convert) reads a FastQ file, strips off the first
  10 bases of the sequence, and prints a FastA format to STDOUT.

* run.py runs strip-and-convert using Python's multiprocess.Pool
  Yay for multicore.
